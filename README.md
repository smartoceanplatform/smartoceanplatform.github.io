# Smart Ocean Work Package 3

## Software technology and big-data middleware

The work package on software technology and big-data middleware focusses on a digital eco-system providing cloud-based ocean data services and supporting cost-effective development of software applications that consumes ocean data services.

The cloud-based smart ocean platform is to comprise a set of software frameworks enabling the integration of external and internal ocean data sources, data storage and processing, and application deployment.  The platform is to enable data spaces based on a uniform and standardised set of APIs and data formats.  The software technology being developed in the work package is being validated through the development of application prototypes linked to consortium pilot demonstrators and through the deployment of a reference implementation that integrates with external systems and data services.

The main topics of the work package includes development and implementation of the smart ocean platform, system-of-systems software architecture, engineering technology for smart software systems, sensor-cloud integration middleware and protocols, edge computing, interoperability and data service APIs, data quality- and integrity, software security and reliability, machine learning and analytics, and intelligent visualisation of big datasets.
