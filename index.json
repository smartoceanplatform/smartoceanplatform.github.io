	"content": "The messaging service of the SmartOcean platform supports publishing data and subscribing to real-time data streams The messaging service is based on the publish-subscribe paradigm and the MQTT protocol. In this paradigm, data providers publish data topics while data consumers subscribe to topic in order to receive data published on the topic.\nThe messaging service is comprised of two HiveMQ MQTT messaging clusters\n A Data Ingestion Messaging Service for delivering data to the platform A Core Messaging Messaging Service for data transformation, forwarding and consumption  as illustrated in the figure below. The data ingestion service receives data in formats determined by the data sources and a transformation to the SmartOcean data format is performed prior to publishing the data on the core messaging service for further processing.\nThe data ingestion service requires authentication for data provisioning with the following topic structure\nsmartocean/\u0026lt;domain\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;site\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;subsite\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;node\u0026gt; The data transformation component published the transformed data on the corresponding topic:\nsmartocean/\u0026lt;domain\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;site\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;subsite\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;node\u0026gt;/raw Currently the following topics are in used corresponding to the data sources of SFI SmartOcean pilot demonstrator 1\nsmartocean/pilotdemo_0001/austevoll/north/seaguardII_0001 smartocean/pilotdemo_0001/austevoll/south/seaguardII_0002 smartocean/pilotdemo_0001/austevoll/wsense/node1 smartocean/testing/virtualsensorhub "

Hence, it facilitates the transfer of data from the information acquisition layer into the data and application service layer (see Figure~\\ref{fig:smartoceansystem}). The integration point is needed since the UWSNs operate with highly specialised communication protocols intended for acoustic communication and the data will have be provided to a gateway service via, e.g., 5G, WiFI, cabling or satellite communication.

	"content": "In-situ marine data is prone to error due to several factors. Underwater sensors may produce a lot of anomalies when powered by low-batteries. Biofouling is an accumulation of microorganisms, plants, algae, or small animals on underwater sensors, resulting in unexpected measurement results. If low-quality data is used in decision-making processes, the results will be misleading or suboptimal; thus, data quality control (DQC) must be done to ensure data reliability.\nFor now, DQC activities predominantly relies on manual checks. Thanks to today\u0026rsquo;s advanced sensory technologies, vast amounts of data are collected on a daily basis. Manual DQC can be time-consuming and lead to significant delays in data publication. To address this challenge and speed up the DQC process, we are developing an automated DQC framework called Adaptive Anomaly Detector (AdapAD) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically unsupervised anomaly detection.\nThe framework aims to detect anomalous measurements from real-time data, which support data validators and data consumers to assess the quality of data for further usage.\n"
