The integration point is needed since the UWSNs operate with highly specialised communication protocols intended for acoustic communication and the data will have be provided to a gateway service via, e.g., 5G, WiFI, cabling or satellite communication.

	"content": "In-situ marine data is prone to error due to several factors. Underwater sensors may produce a lot of anomalies when powered by low-batteries. Biofouling is an accumulation of microorganisms, plants, algae, or small animals on underwater sensors, resulting in unexpected measurement results. If low-quality data is used in decision-making processes, the results will be misleading or suboptimal; thus, data quality control (DQC) must be done to ensure data reliability.\nFor now, DQC activities predominantly relies on manual checks. Thanks to today\u0026rsquo;s advanced sensory technologies, vast amounts of data are collected on a daily basis. Manual DQC can be time-consuming and lead to significant delays in data publication. To address this challenge and speed up the DQC process, we are developing an automated DQC framework called Adaptive Anomaly Detector (AdapAD) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically unsupervised anomaly detection.\nThe framework aims to detect anomalous measurements from real-time data, which support data validators and data consumers to assess the quality of data for further usage.\n"
